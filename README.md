## OpenMakaEngine Project

!! THIS IS A VISUAL STUDIO 2010 Project !!

This project was invented to implement all common approaches of markerless object detection within opencv.

To make a decision which configuration should be used with OpenMakaAndroid App, i made several performance tests stored in test-results/.
